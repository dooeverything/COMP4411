DOO Dongkyu (20379251)

All basic requirements completed

For particle system, implemented a breath and rain particle.

Project 4 Complete Bonus List
1. Adaptive de Casteljau subdivision algorithm for Bezier (Not implement to show Flatness parameter and the number of points) (1W)

2. TGA file reader (1W)
-> TGA file in textures/tga/cloud.tga
-> Used 'cloud.tga' to implement basic requirement of particle system

3. Billbording (1W)
-> You can see that 'breath particles' keep facing the camera 

4. C2 Interpolating Curve (BB)

P.S
Since tga file take up too much memory, if I run animation with particle systems more than 15 seconds, the system keep throwing memory allocation failure.
So, I change the endTime from 20 seconds to 15 seconds.
Also, if you click a simulation buttion and run a program more than 1 minute, it may give a memory allocation error.
I am sorry for this inconvience
